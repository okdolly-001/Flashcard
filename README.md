## Flashcard

Using a minimal setup with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/),
[Babel](http://babeljs.io/), and [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) from
https://github.com/ahfarmer/minimal-react-starter

- server.js : 
- public/index.html: entry point
- src/main.js: where React renders element to HTML.

This starter is as minimal as possible while still including Babel and Webpack.

## Setup

```
npm install
```

## Usage

1. `node server.js`

2. Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
